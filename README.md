# Bryan Gilmore II – IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I am focused on blue team work, threat hunting, and security operations.  
My goal is to highlight hands-on labs and investigations where I work with real tools, real logs, and document everything in a way that would fit into a SOC or IR workflow.
