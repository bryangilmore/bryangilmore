# Bryan Gilmore II | Security and Backend Engineering Portfolio

I build production shaped projects in two areas: security operations and backend engineering.  
My goal is to ship clean, documented work that is easy to review, run, and reproduce.

## Backend Engineering Projects
- **B2B Portal Backend (Java, Spring Boot, Postgres)**  
  Flagship backend project focused on reliability, scalability, and production readiness. (WIP)
  Repo: [b2b-portal-backend](LINK_HERE)

- **Foundations Toolkit (Python, Linux, Networking, Git)**  
  Small utilities and mini projects used to build fundamentals.  
  Repo: [foundations-toolkit](https://github.com/bryangilmore/foundations-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file)

- **Java DSA Portfolio**  
  Data structures and algorithms in Java with tests and notes. (WIP) 
  Repo: [java-dsa](LINK_HERE)

## Cybersecurity Projects
### Vulnerability Management
- **Windows Server 2019 STIG + Nessus Remediation Lab**  
  Hardening a Windows Server 2019 host using Nessus and DISA STIG findings, then remediating with PowerShell.  
  Repo: [Windows Server 2019 STIG + Nessus Remediation Lab](https://github.com/bryangilmore/Windows-Server-2019-STIG-Nessus-Lab/tree/main)

### Threat Hunting and Security Operations
- **Azure Threat Hunt – Port of Entry**  
  End to end investigation of a simulated breach in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft 365 Defender.  
  Repo: [Azure Threat Hunt – Port of Entry](https://github.com/bryangilmore/Azure-Threat-Hunt-Port-of-Entry)

## Current Focus
- Building the B2B Portal Backend through weekly milestone releases
- Strengthening Linux and networking fundamentals for reliability work
